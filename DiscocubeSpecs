Abstract.

Story of an artist choosing a mathematical object as muse, and rendering that vision accordingly.
reconfiguration of the 200-year-old disco ball
    from a skin to a circulatory system. internalize the external
    that was not a copy but as unique as a fingerprint
    which can be polished like a diamond.
    where the reflections aren't regular but unpredictable, unique for each discocube.
    which doesn't require multiple light sources for illumination, only one.
    conceived in an era in which algorithms run our world.
    that was inspired by dancing to techno, not to the charleston.
deconstruct discoball into a single line:
    peel discoball's skin resulting in a long single strip of square mirror tiles.
    this is the line used to draw / describe the shape.
which shape?:
    plato associated each solid to an element:
        cube -> earth
        octahedron -> sky
        icosahedron -> water
        tetrahedron -> fire
    which element/s describe the movement of the body in dance?
        dance is tension between earth and sky.
        earth + sky = dance
        cube + octahedron = dance
    how cube + octahedron?
        a cube made of octahedrons or an octahedron made of cubes?
            hauy construction (there's an actual name for this)!
take deconstructed discoball and use it to describe discocube shape.
    how describe shape:
        not the surface like a discoball but the structure.
        process of moving the outside (skin) inside (circulatory system) the body.
        circulatory system -> circular -> hamiltonian cycle
    how to find / draw a hamiltonian cycle*?
        are there hamiltonian cycles in the dc graph?
        smallest instances -> hand drawing.
        next instance -> dfs search
        after? -> intractable as dfs
    set moving goal posts:
        write algorithm that finds the hamiltonian cycle in all discograph instances in ~~exponential~~, ~~pseudopolynomial~~, ~~polynomial~~, linear time.
        write algorithm that finds an always turning cycle in polynomial time.
** discocube graph: a bipartite, two-colorable, finite subgraph of the infinite 3D integer square grid graph whose vertices and edges are contained within the region enclosed by an octahedron and is defined by the inequality  |x| + |y| + |z| ≤ r, where x, y, and z are integers. The discocube graph is a Haüy construction (A method of constructing polyhedra using identical building blocks first described by René Just Haüy in his investigations into crystallography) of an octahedron, a structure formed by accreting cubes around a central cube. The orders of each successive subgraph are given by the uncentered octahedral numbers (OEIS A130809).

* hamiltonian cycle: a cycle that passes through every vertex of a graph exactly once. In other words, it is a path that starts and ends at the same vertex, and visits every other vertex exactly once along the way. Finding a Hamiltonian cycle in a graph is a well-known problem in computer science and graph theory, generally considered to be a computationally difficult problem for large graphs. Choosing a Hamiltonian cycle as a reduction of the graph allows for sufficient space for light to bounce around inside the object because only the edges that connect the vertices are included.
