###Abstract.

Story of an artist choosing a mathematical object as muse, and rendering that vision accordingly.
reconfiguration of the 200-year-old disco ball
    from a skin to a circulatory system. internalize the external
    that was not a copy but as unique as a fingerprint
    which can be polished like a diamond.
    where the reflections aren't regular but unpredictable, unique for each discocube.
    which doesn't require multiple light sources for illumination, only one.
    conceived in an era in which algorithms run our world.
    that was inspired by dancing to techno, not to the charleston.
deconstruct discoball into a single line:
    peel discoball's skin resulting in a long single strip of square mirror tiles.
    join ends to form a loop.
    this is the line used to draw / describe the shape.
    a loop can represent the internal structure of an object 
    interconnectivity and complexity, represents interconnected systems within systems.
which shape?:
    plato associated each solid to an element:
        cube -> earth
        octahedron -> sky
        icosahedron -> water
        tetrahedron -> fire
    which element/s describe the movement of the body in dance?
        dance is tension between earth and sky.
        earth + sky = dance
        cube + octahedron = dance
    how cube + octahedron?
        a cube made of octahedrons or an octahedron made of cubes?
            hauy construction (there's an actual name for this)!
take deconstructed discoball and use it to describe discocube shape.
    how describe shape:
        not the surface like a discoball but the structure.
        process of moving the outside (skin) inside (circulatory system) the body.
        circulatory system -> circular -> hamiltonian cycle
    how to find / draw a hamiltonian cycle*?
        are there hamiltonian cycles in the dc graph?
        smallest instances -> hand drawing.
        next instance -> dfs search
        after? -> intractable as dfs
    set moving goal posts:
        write algorithm that finds the hamiltonian cycle in all discograph instances in ~~exponential~~, ~~pseudopolynomial~~, ~~polynomial~~, linear time.
        write algorithm that finds an always turning cycle in polynomial time.
** discocube graph: a bipartite, two-colorable, finite subgraph of the infinite 3D integer square grid graph whose vertices and edges are contained 
within the region enclosed by an octahedron and is defined by the inequality  |x| + |y| + |z| ≤ r, where x, y, and z are integers. The discocube graph 
is a Haüy construction (A method of constructing polyhedra using identical building blocks first described by René Just Haüy in his investigations 
into crystallography) of an octahedron, a structure formed by accreting cubes around a central cube. The orders of each successive subgraph are given 
by the uncentered octahedral numbers (OEIS A130809).

* hamiltonian cycle: a cycle that passes through every vertex of a graph exactly once. In other words, it is a path that starts and ends at the
* same vertex, and visits every other vertex exactly once along the way. Finding a Hamiltonian cycle in a graph is a well-known problem in computer 
* science and graph theory, generally considered to be a computationally difficult problem for large graphs. Choosing a Hamiltonian cycle as a 
* reduction of the graph allows for sufficient space for light to bounce around inside the object because only the minimum number of edges are used to connect all the vertices together 
* are included.

asks the question? 
mirrors are only skin deep.
The blood circulatory system is a system of organs that includes the heart, blood vessels, and blood which is circulated throughout the entire body of a human or other vertebrate.
what is a circulatory system as a drawing? a contour drawing the insides of the body,

not skin deep but deeper, into the systems that carry our blood throughout our body, a 
expression of the artistic process as an algorithm.

outer body, 
if we see the placement of the mirrored tiles on a discoball as an outer covering, akin to skin.
going deeper:
dna is typically found in closed loops.
circulatory system is a loop, the structure of dna is a loop.

deconstruct discoball

the shape, form is a sphere, if we define a sphere as, we can alter the distance p factor resulting in 
a cube being a sphere, or an octahedron,
