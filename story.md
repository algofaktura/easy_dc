Discoball becoming a discocube.
What else can it be? 
a sphere is not always perfectly round.
A sphere is defined as the set of points with the same distance r from a center point in three-dimensional space.
Using the generalization of the Euclidean and Manhattan distance, the Minkowski metric (d(x, y) = (∑ᵢ |xᵢ - yᵢ|ᵖ)¹∕ₚ, where p ≥ 1) to determine the radius of the sphere where p = 1, 2 or ∞ yields spheres with the shapes of an octahedron, a round sphere and a cube respectively.

{(x, y, z) | (x - c₁)² + (y - c₂)² + (z - c₃)² = r²} -> {(x, y, z) | x² + y² + z² = r²}
A perfectly round sphere is when p is 2, 

{(x, y, z) | |x - c₁| + |y - c₂| + |z - c₃| = r} -> {(x, y, z) | |x| + |y| + |z| = r}
an octahedron when p is 1.

{(x, y, z) | max(c₁ - x, x - c₁) + max(c₂ - y, y - c₂) + max(c₃ - z, z - c₃) = r} -> {(x, y, z) | max(|x|, |y|, |z|) = r}
a cube when p approaches infinity.

Sphere to p-norm ball, from skin to body:
As the sphere is defined by the points that share the same distance from the origin, those points only describe the surface, the skin.
When each mirror tile is seen as a point, the tiles on the disco ball also only describe the surface.
The definition for the p-norm ball, on the other hand, encompasses all points whose distance from the origin is less than or equal to the specified p-norm, thus including both its interior and surface points.


Peeling the mirrors from the discoball to yield one large strip of mirrors side by side.
Possible forms for the discocube are: cube or octahedron or both.
Layering meanings.
Plato ascribed the element earth to the cube, and air to the octahedron. 
If we mix Plato's symbols | signs: cube as earth + octahedron as air can symbolize dancing: 
    the push and pull of the body between earth and air, 
    the tension between stability and balance.

When each mirror tile represents a point, then in the case of the discoball, the points also only describe the surface. Its description of the shape if hollow.
let's not limit ourselves to describing the surface but structure within the ball like a cardiovascular system.
Unlike the sphere, which only describes its surface through equidistant points from the origin, the p-norm ball includes all points within its boundary that are less than or equal to the specified p-norm distance from the origin. Therefore, the points in the p-norm ball describe not only its surface, but also its subsurface and interior.
if we define our p-norm ball where p = 1 and {(x, y, z) | x, y, z ∈ ℤ, -max_xyz ≤ x, y, z ≤ max_xyz, x ≡ y ≡ z ≡ ±1 (mod 2), |x| + |y| + |z| < (max_xyz + 4)}

let's peel the mirrors into a single row of tiled mirrors and join the ends forming a loop.
If we use this loop to connect each of the points defined by our p-norm ball we get the hamiltonian cycle problem which is: 

how does one deconstruct the mirrors from the surface of the ball? 
By peeling it in such a way that the resulting peel is one long strip of mirrors side by side, like a thread of yarn.


how about a bunch of pictures and some text to go along with it? 


so i need to get the pictures as a jpeg and use then to narrate the story of becoming discocube.
